Title: Analysis of Stable Matchings in R
Author: Thilo Klein
Maintainer: Thilo Klein <thilo@klein.uk>
Description: Implements structural estimators to correct for the
    sample selection bias from observed outcomes in matching markets. These 
    include the one-sided matching of agents into groups as well the two-sided 
    matching of students to schools. The package also contains R code for three 
    matching algorithms: the deferred-acceptance (or Gale-Shapley) algorithm for 
    stable marriage and college admissions problems, the top-trading-cycles algorithm 
    for house allocation and a partitioning linear program for the roommates problem.
